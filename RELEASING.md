# Releasing Buzz

Buzz has two independent release lanes. Desktop and relay use release PRs:

| Lane | Entry point | Artifact |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Desktop | `just release-desktop <version>` | Packaged desktop app (signed/notarized macOS, unsigned Windows, and Linux) |
| Relay | `just release-relay` | `ghcr.io/block/buzz` container image |

The lanes version independently. Desktop reads its manifests and relay reads its
crate manifest.

## Quick Start

Prepare desktop releases locally from an up-to-date, clean `main` checkout:

```sh
just release-desktop 0.5.3
```

The recipe generates the immutable candidate and opens or updates its pull
request. Candidate branch creation uses the operator's GitHub permissions; the
release App is intentionally limited to creating protected release tags.

```sh
# Relay release
just release-relay
just release-relay 0.4.0
```

Desktop uses an immutable generated candidate PR; relay continues using its
metadata PR.

## How It Works

### Desktop

1. Run `just release-desktop <version>` from a clean, up-to-date `main` checkout.
   The script creates one deterministic candidate commit and records both its
   frozen base and the verified prior release ledger in candidate metadata.
2. Review the exact candidate SHA, complete changelog, and CI. Regenerating or
   pushing the branch creates a new candidate and requires checks to run again.
3. **Squash merge** the PR after all protected-branch checks pass. The merge is
   the human authorization event; an authorized owner/admin bypass is treated
   the same way. Unrelated changes reaching `main` do not invalidate the
   reviewed candidate.
4. `auto-tag-on-release-pr-merge` verifies the closed event against GitHub's PR
   identity, validates candidate content, and proves every required check came
   from its trusted producer and was successful when the PR merged. It creates
   `desktop-v<version>` at the exact reviewed PR head—not the squash commit.
   Retries accept that tag only at the same SHA and never move it. GitHub does
   not expose when an individual check rerun was created, so an ordinary rerun
   after merge deliberately makes tag verification fail closed; inspect that
   run and create a new candidate version rather than retrying the blocked tag.
5. The tag triggers `release.yml`. It builds and stages all platform artifacts,
   publishes the versioned release only after the complete set succeeds, then
   updates the rolling updater manifest last for stable versions.

Because squash merging leaves immutable candidate tags on side history, the next
release uses validated prior candidate metadata as its ledger boundary. It
includes unrelated commits after the prior frozen base and excludes exactly the
prior release's recorded squash commit; tag ancestry is deliberately irrelevant.

### Relay

1. **`just release-relay`** runs locally on `main`, creates or updates a
   `relay-release/<version>` PR, bumps `crates/buzz-relay/Cargo.toml`,
   regenerates `Cargo.lock`, and updates the relay changelog.
2. **Merge the PR.** `auto-tag-on-release-pr-merge` pushes
   `relay-v<version>`.
3. **The tag triggers `docker.yml`.** Stable releases update the version
   aliases and `latest`; prereleases do not. Each release also publishes an
   optimized, symbol-bearing image under matching `debug-` tags (for example,
   `debug-0.3.0` and `debug-latest`) for native profiling. The ordinary tags
   remain stripped and are the default for deployments that do not need it.

Every push to `main` continues to publish the rolling relay `:main` and
`:sha-<7>` tags, plus matching `:debug-main` and `:debug-sha-<7>` variants.

## Version Sources

| Lane | Release version authority |
|------|---------------------------|
| Desktop | `desktop/package.json` and synchronized desktop manifests |
| Relay | `crates/buzz-relay/Cargo.toml` |

`just bump-desktop-version <version>` updates the desktop manifests and
regenerates their lockfiles. `just bump-relay-version <version>` updates the
relay crate and regenerates `Cargo.lock`.

## Signed macOS Canary

Use the manual **Signed macOS Canary** workflow when you need an Apple Silicon
build of current `main` for explicit testing without publishing a release:

```sh
gh workflow run signed-macos-canary.yml --repo block/buzz --ref main
```

The workflow derives a `-test.<run-number>` version, signs and notarizes the
DMG, verifies it with Gatekeeper, and uploads it as a short-lived Actions
artifact with seven-day retention. Because this is a public repository, any
signed-in GitHub user can download that artifact while it exists; it is
unpublished, not private. The workflow has no release permissions, does not
create or move tags, and cannot update `buzz-desktop-latest` or `latest.json`.

Download the artifact from the completed run:

```sh
gh run download <run-id> --repo block/buzz --name <artifact-name>
```

The workflow intentionally accepts only `main`. Use the normal release process
for distributable builds or builds from an immutable release tag.

---

## Release Retry

`release.yml` has no manual dispatch and cannot build from `main` or another
caller-selected ref. If a run for an existing immutable
`desktop-v<version>` tag fails, rerun that failed workflow from GitHub Actions
(or use `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed --repo block/buzz`). A rerun
repairs the versioned draft if publication did not complete. It does not
promote that version to the auto-updater; promotion is a separate manual
action. Do not recreate, move, or push the immutable tag again.

---

## Internal Releases

For desktop, start
[Release Desktop](https://buildkite.com/runway/sprout-releases) and enter the
exact public source tag as `desktop_ref=desktop-v<version>`; a generic
`v<version>` tag is intentionally rejected. See the
[buzz-releases README](https://github.com/squareup/buzz-releases#cutting-a-release)
for the rest of the private pipeline contract.

---

## What Gets Published

Desktop publishes two GitHub releases:

1. **`desktop-v<version>`**: the user-facing release with installers and the
   exact `updater-manifest.json` promotion candidate. Publishing this release
   does not expose it through in-app auto-update.
2. **`buzz-desktop-latest`**: the rolling auto-updater release. Its
   `latest.json` changes only through the manual promotion workflow.

### Promote an OSS desktop release to auto-update

After installing and testing the published `desktop-v<version>` artifacts, run
**Promote OSS Desktop Auto-Update** from the `main` branch and enter the exact
stable `X.Y.Z` version. The workflow validates the immutable tag and release,
the retained manifest and every referenced updater asset, and requires the
version to be newer than the currently promoted version before replacing
`buzz-desktop-latest/latest.json`. Same-version retries succeed only when the
manifest is identical; downgrades are rejected.

Withholding promotion leaves existing clients on the previous version. If a
promoted release is bad, ship and promote a higher patch version; changing the
manifest to an older version does not downgrade clients that already updated.

---

## Platform Support

The release workflow builds **two separate macOS DMGs**: Apple
Silicon (`darwin-aarch64`, the `release` job) and Intel
(`darwin-x86_64`, the `release-macos-x64` job), an unsigned Windows x64
NSIS installer (its filename includes `_alpha-unsigned`), and Linux `.deb` and
`.AppImage` packages. Both macOS DMGs are codesigned, notarized, and attached
to the same `desktop-v<version>` release. Intel users
download the `_x64.dmg`.

The Linux AppImage is post-processed by `desktop/scripts/fix-appimage.sh`,
which strips infra libraries over-bundled by linuxdeploy (they crash on
Mesa 25+ / GLib 2.88 distros; see
[tauri-apps/tauri#15665](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/15665))
and re-signs the artifact. As a result the AppImage relies on the
host's Wayland/GStreamer/graphics stack and requires GLib >= 2.72
(Ubuntu 22.04 or newer). The `release-linux` job builds inside a
`ubuntu:22.04` container for broad GLIBC compatibility.

## Troubleshooting

### The desktop candidate is stale or cannot be squash merged

Do not update the branch manually and do not weaken the ruleset. Run
`just release-desktop <version>` again from current `main`; this regenerates the
candidate, reruns CI, and requires a fresh trusted approval on the new exact
head. The post-merge verifier refuses to tag a squash whose parent differs from
the recorded candidate base or whose tree differs from the validated PR head.

### Local `just release-desktop` fails with "must be on main branch"
Switch to `main` and pull latest before running the release recipe.

### Local `just release-desktop` fails with "working tree is dirty"
Commit or stash your changes before running the release recipe.

### Auto-updater reports "no update available"
Verify that the `buzz-desktop-latest` release exists and contains a
valid `latest.json`. The manifest covers all four platform keys
(`darwin-aarch64`, `darwin-x86_64`, `linux-x86_64`,
`windows-x86_64`); a missing entry usually means that platform's
release job failed. Check the workflow run.
